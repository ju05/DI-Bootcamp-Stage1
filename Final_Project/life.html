    	<div>Li was born in Beijing, China. When she was 12 (1988), her father moved to the US; when she was 15, she and her mother joined him in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey.
    	She graduated from High School and started her Undergraduate studies at Princeton. While she was in college, she borrowed money from friends and even her high school math teacher to buy a dry cleaning business for her parents.
    	Li is married with a co-worker Silvio Savarese, also a computer scientis at Stanford. They have a litle boy together.

    </div>
    	<div>An activist for more diversity in the Computer Science field <br>
    	In a recent interview, Li was asked why she talks about the need to have more women involved in AI. She answered:<br>
        <br><em>"More jobs will be related to artificial intelligence, so we need a huge workforce, and we need a more inclusive base. That’s an economic argument. There are also tons of studies that have shown that when a diverse group of workers come together, the solutions they find in their work are more innovative and more creative. That drives innovation. But it’s also moral and ethical.</em><br>
        <em>When you are making a technology this pervasive and this important for humanity, you want it to carry the values of the entire humanity, and serve the needs of the entire humanity. If the developers of this technology do not represent all walks of life, it is very likely that this will be a biased technology. I say this as a technologist, a researcher, and a mother. And we need to be speaking about this clearly and loudly."</em></div>
